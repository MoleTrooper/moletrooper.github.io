# Introduction
![selfie](/assets/selfie.jpg) Mikael Myyrä, perhaps more often known by his online alias MoleTrooper,
is a professional programmer, university student majoring in computer science, and general nerdlord
from Jyväskylä, Finland. He has unreasonably high ambitions in all areas of his life, especially his hobbies.
These include but are not limited to game development, graphic art, disc golf, and going very fast in video games.
Having finished his bachelor's degree he is currently taking a year off studying,
working as a software developer at the University of Jyväskylä Digital Services,
and writing about himself in third person in an attempt to sound
just pretentious enough to seem competent but not so much as to be offputting.

![avatar](/assets/avatar.png) When it comes to games and code, Mole's passions lie in geometry and movement. His pet project and the primary
subject of his blog is MoleEngine, a general-purpose 2D game engine with a focus on physics and ease of use.
He has strong opinions on game design and considers himself an expert on platformers.
